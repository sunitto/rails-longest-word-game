This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

This is an exercise that I did as a test. I had 3 hours to complete as much as possible.
I didn't do enough but I decided to work on it as a test/playground to try to improve on ruby.

As a user, I have to create an account and connect to play.
The user can create a new game
As we create a game, we can create a party (up to 5 per game)
- The app will generate a list of 10 letters randomly with at least 5 vowels and 5 consonents.
- The user will have to type a word, the longest word as possible.
- The app will validate the word:

  ---The user can't submit a word with more letters than is available in the list.
  ---The user can't use letters that are not in the list.
  ---The user have to submit a word that exist.
  ---If it is ok, then the user will gain 1 point per letter.
